# Rotated-sorted-array
This Python function, `search_rotated_array`, locates a target element in a rotated sorted array. Using binary search, it identifies which portion of the array is sorted, then adjusts search boundaries accordingly. Efficient and effective, it returns the index of the target if found, or -1 if absent.
